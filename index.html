        <h2>WHY ME??</h2>
        <p>You have so many tiny, special things that make you you ....the little gestures, the way you laugh, the way you light up a room without even trying. But beyond all of that, youâ€™re just an ordinary person, like any other cheerful, social, impatience, Holding Onto Grudges, and easygoing soul <br><br>

        Loving someone for their beauty or perfection is easy.. But truly loving someone, their quirks, their</p>
      </div>
      <div class="back">
        <p> everyday moments, their simplest self thatâ€™s something deeper... And with you, itâ€™s effortless... Because even in your ordinariness, youâ€™re the most extraordinary person to me. ðŸ§¡<br><br>

        And maybe thatâ€™s what draws me to you the most... the way youâ€™re both familiar and unpredictable, the way your presence feels effortless yet impossible to ignore.. Thereâ€™s something about you, something in the way you move, the way you tease without meaning to, the way your lips curve when youâ€™re amused... </p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="page">
      <div class="front">
        <p> It drives me crazy in the best way!!<br><br>

        And the worst part? You donâ€™t even have to try. You just exist.. completely yourself, completely unfiltered and it undoes me.... Every glance, every playful smirk, every time you lean in just a little too close without even realizing what youâ€™re doing.. Itâ€™s maddening in the most addictive way </p>

        <h2>A BOOK</h2>
        <p>Can WE be US??<br><br>

        Iâ€™ve tried to find the perfect words, but the truth is, there will never be enough words to express how much you mean to me-- <br><br>

        You already know that I love you... how could you not? Itâ€™s in the way I look at you, in the way my voice softens when I say your name, and in the way I canâ€™t help but smile every time your notification pops. </p>
      </div>
      <div class="back">
        <p> But what you may not know is how much this love grows with every passing moment. Every time I see you, every time I hear you, every time you do that little thing that only you can do, my heart feels sad<br><br>

        I crave you.... not just your presence, but everything that comes with it. I dream of the day I can wrap my arms around you and hold you so tightly that the world itself disappears. I crave to feel your hand in mine, to feel the warmth of your fingers tied with mine, as if our hands were made to fit together.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
    
    
    <div class="page">
      <div class="front">
        <p> I crave to kiss you honey not for the physical sake, but to express my love to you in a way that words never could<br><br>

        You are my dream girl, my everything. And with every passing day, my love for you becomes more than just a feeling... itâ€™s a need, a part of me saying I just want you at all costs.. I donâ€™t just want to be near you, I want to be with you.<br><br> I want to love you not for a moment, but for forever and ever...<br>I know this might sound dramatic, and maybe Iâ€™m being a little too</p>
      </div>
      <div class="back">
        <p>vulnerable here, but I canâ€™t keep this inside any longer. You are the first thing I think about when I wake up and the last thought on my mind before I fall asleep. You are my happiest daydream and my most beautiful reality<br><br>

        Even if you tried, you couldnâ€™t stop me from loving you. I donâ€™t love you because I want something in return. I love you because you are you and everything I do not have..<br><br> 

        But if thereâ€™s even the slightest chance that you feel something for me, I request you to take a chance on us. Let me show you what this</p>
      </div>
    </div>


    <div class="page">
      <div class="front">
        <p>love could be. Let me hold your hand, kiss your lips, and be the one who makes you laugh when life gets hard. Let me love you in a way that youâ€™ve never been loved before<br><br>
        I promise you, with everything I am, that you will never regret being with me. Every moment we share will be filled with love, laughter, and memories that weâ€™ll cherish forever. Iâ€™ll do everything in my power to make you feel loved every single day...
        <br><br>I canâ€™t promise life will always be perfect, but I promise you this: Iâ€™ll</p>
      </div>
      <div class="back">
        <p>never give up on us. Iâ€™ll fight for our love and protect it with everything I have. Youâ€™re not just someone I want to be with today; youâ€™re the one I want to be with forever (FOREVER)<br>
                <br><br>
You already have my heart, Shambhavi, now give me yours too...<br><br>Shlok <3</p></p>

        <p> is different. Like they do change maine khud dekha hai. I just want ki wapas woh naa ho. Boys ko ye samjh nai ata hai ki tum before relationship kaise chase karte ho hame wahi hame during relationship bhi chahiye because you know how much that means... special feelings hoti hai woh. Mostly ye sab samjh nai ata hai and also you are pretty new to relationship toh tuje I guess batana yehi sahi time rahega. Baki choti choti details deti rahungi ðŸ’“</p>
