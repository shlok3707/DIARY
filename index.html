        <h2>1.WHY ME??</h2>
        <p>You have so many tiny, special things that make you you ....the little gestures, the way you laugh, the way you light up a room without even trying. But beyond all of that, youâ€™re just an ordinary person, like any other cheerful, social, impatience, Holding Onto Grudges, and easygoing soul <br><br>

        Loving someone for their beauty or perfection is easy.. But truly loving someone, their quirks, their</p>
      </div>
      <div class="back">
        <p> everyday moments, their simplest self thatâ€™s something deeper... And with you, itâ€™s effortless... Because even in your ordinariness, youâ€™re the most extraordinary person to me. ðŸ§¡<br><br>

        And maybe thatâ€™s what draws me to you the most... the way youâ€™re both familiar and unpredictable, the way your presence feels effortless yet impossible to ignore.. Thereâ€™s something about you, something in the way you move, the way you tease without meaning to, the way your lips curve when youâ€™re amused... </p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="page">
      <div class="front">
        <p> It drives me crazy in the best way!!<br><br>

        And the worst part? You donâ€™t even have to try. You just exist.. completely yourself, completely unfiltered and it undoes me.... Every glance, every playful smirk, every time you lean in just a little too close without even realizing what youâ€™re doing.. Itâ€™s maddening in the most addictive way </p>

        <h2>2.A BOOK</h2>
        <p>Can WE be US??<br><br>

        Iâ€™ve tried to find the perfect words, but the truth is, there will never be enough words to express how much you mean to me-- <br><br>

        You already know that I love you... how could you not? Itâ€™s in the way I look at you, in the way my voice softens when I say your name, and in the way I canâ€™t help but smile every time your notification pops. </p>
      </div>
      <div class="back">
        <p> But what you may not know is how much this love grows with every passing moment. Every time I see you, every time I hear you, every time you do that little thing that only you can do, my heart feels sad<br><br>

        I crave you.... not just your presence, but everything that comes with it. I dream of the day I can wrap my arms around you and hold you so tightly that the world itself disappears. I crave to feel your hand in mine, to feel the warmth of your fingers tied with mine, as if our hands were made to fit together.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
    
    
    <div class="page">
      <div class="front">
        <p> I crave to kiss you honey not for the physical sake, but to express my love to you in a way that words never could<br><br>

        You are my dream girl, my everything. And with every passing day, my love for you becomes more than just a feeling... itâ€™s a need, a part of me saying I just want you at all costs.. I donâ€™t just want to be near you, I want to be with you.<br><br> I want to love you not for a moment, but for forever and ever...<br>I know this might sound dramatic, and maybe Iâ€™m being a little too</p>
      </div>
      <div class="back">
        <p>vulnerable here, but I canâ€™t keep this inside any longer. You are the first thing I think about when I wake up and the last thought on my mind before I fall asleep. You are my happiest daydream and my most beautiful reality<br><br>

        Even if you tried, you couldnâ€™t stop me from loving you. I donâ€™t love you because I want something in return. I love you because you are you and everything I do not have..<br><br> 

        But if thereâ€™s even the slightest chance that you feel something for me, I request you to take a chance on us. Let me show you what this</p>
      </div>
    </div>


    <div class="page">
      <div class="front">
        <p>love could be. Let me hold your hand, kiss your lips, and be the one who makes you laugh when life gets hard. Let me love you in a way that youâ€™ve never been loved before<br><br>
        I promise you, with everything I am, that you will never regret being with me. Every moment we share will be filled with love, laughter, and memories that weâ€™ll cherish forever. Iâ€™ll do everything in my power to make you feel loved every single day...
        <br><br>I canâ€™t promise life will always be perfect, but I promise you this: Iâ€™ll</p>
      </div>
      <div class="back">
        <p>never give up on us. Iâ€™ll fight for our love and protect it with everything I have. Youâ€™re not just someone I want to be with today; youâ€™re the one I want to be with forever (FOREVER)<br>
                <br><br>
You already have my heart, Shambhavi, now give me yours too...<br><br>Shlok <3</p></p>
